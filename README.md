# applescript-repo
These are set of applescripts for educational use and to learn from. 
Use them at your own risk. I express to no warranty. These are intended to help 
folks trying to solve their own problems using AppleScript.

These are all designed around using FastScripts by Red Sweater. I found it to be the most reliable tool
for triggering on per-app basis as well as testing. 

1Password scripts are for 1Password 8 unless denoted in the script to say 7. They are finicky for v8 and tricky
as it is Electron app with some accesibility access. They can work and are useful if you need/want keyboard shortcuts
for certain actions
However, they seem to have to be tweaked depending on your vault name and view setup.
